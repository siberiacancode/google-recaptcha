---

The React package provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Google reCAPTCHA into React applications. Built specifically for React, it offers hooks, components, and providers that seamlessly integrate with your React workflow while supporting all reCAPTCHA versions including [v3](./versions/v3), [v2-invisible](./versions/v2-invisible), and [v2-checkbox](./versions/v2-checkbox).

## Installation

Install the React package using your preferred package manager:

```package-install
npm install @google-recaptcha/react
```

## Setup

All reCAPTCHA functionality requires wrapping your application with the `GoogleReCaptchaProvider`. This provider manages the reCAPTCHA script loading and provides context to child components.

```tsx
import { GoogleReCaptchaProvider } from '@google-recaptcha/react';

export const App = () => (
  <GoogleReCaptchaProvider type='v3 | v2-checkbox | v2-invisible' siteKey='your_site_key'>
    ...
  </GoogleReCaptchaProvider>
);
```
